# ðŸŒ¸ ORIA DAWN â€” A Web3 Portfolio by Amelia Belardinelli

Welcome to **Oria Dawn**, a handcrafted digital garden of code, creativity, and decentralized philosophy.

This is a pixel-art-inspired, Web3-ready personal site built to showcase:
- ðŸŽ¨ Original NFT artwork
- ðŸ§  Prompt engineering projects
- ðŸŒ¿ The intersection of music, trading, and blockchain as creative ecosystems
- ðŸ’¬ Links to Farcaster, Telegram, and more

## ðŸ§© Technologies Used
- HTML5 / CSS3 (minimal, lightweight)
- Custom pixel art + AI-assisted design
- Hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app/)
- Web3 integration planned (Zora, ENS, wallet connect)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Represent my skillset as an artist + prompt engineer
- Create an interactive experience (coming soon!)
- Connect blockchain principles with natural systems and artistic process

## ðŸª´ Roadmap
- [x] V1: Design + Launch Static Portfolio
- [ ] V2: Add NFT Gallery (Zora + Onchain Mint)
